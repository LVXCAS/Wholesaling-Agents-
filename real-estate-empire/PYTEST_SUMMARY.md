   - Incomplete assert statement in `test_negotiator_tools.py`

2. **Import Path Issues Fixed:**
   - Relative imports in `market_simulator.py`
   - Relative imports in `agent_trainer.py`

3. **Missing Classes Handled:**
   - Commented out tests for non-existent `ComprehensiveDealDiscoveryTool`

## ‚ùå Remaining Issues

### Database Connection Issues
- PostgreSQL connection failures in integration tests
- Need to configure test database or use SQLite for testing

### Mock Configuration Issues  
- Lead scoring tests fail due to improper mock setup
- Need better fixture configuration for complex domain objects

### External API Dependencies
- Geocoding service timeouts in neighborhood analysis
- Need to mock external API calls for reliable testing

### Missing Model Imports
- Some test files reference undefined classes (`AlertAnalytics`)
- Need to verify all model imports are correct

## üöÄ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Configure Test Database:** Set up SQLite for testing or mock database operations
2. **Improve Mock Fixtures:** Create proper fixtures for complex domain objects
3. **Mock External APIs:** Replace real API calls with mocks in tests
4. **Fix Missing Imports:** Verify and fix all model import issues

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
1. **Separate Unit vs Integration Tests:** Use pytest markers to separate test types
2. **Add Test Coverage Reporting:** Implement coverage.py for test coverage metrics
3. **Continuous Integration:** Set up automated testing pipeline
4. **Performance Testing:** Add performance benchmarks for critical services
