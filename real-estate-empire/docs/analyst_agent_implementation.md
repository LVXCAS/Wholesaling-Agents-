- Coordinates with other agents through shared state
- Supports workflow orchestration and routing

### **Tool Registry Integration**
- All tools registered with the global tool registry
- Supports tool discovery and execution

- Provides usage statistics and monitoring

## Key Algorithms and Logic

### **Property Valuation Algorithm**
1. Find comparable properties within distance/time constraints
2. Calculate similarity scores based on property characteristics
3. Apply adjustments for condition, location, and size differences
4. Generate weighted average valuation with confidence score

### **Financial Analysis Algorithm**
1. Calculate total investment (purchase + repairs + closing costs)
2. Estimate monthly income and expenses
3. Compute key metrics (cap rate, cash flow, ROI, etc.)
4. Analyze multiple scenarios (conservative, likely, optimistic)

### **Investment Strategy Comparison**
1. Evaluate each strategy based on financial metrics
2. Consider market conditions and timing
3. Assess risk levels and feasibility
4. Rank by risk-adjusted returns
5. Provide detailed recommendation with reasoning

### **Risk Assessment Framework**
1. Analyze financial risks (cap rate, cash flow, leverage)
2. Evaluate property risks (age, condition, location)
3. Consider market risks (trends, inventory, competition)
4. Assess liquidity and financing risks
5. Generate overall risk score and mitigation strategies

## Investment Decision Logic

### **Recommendation Criteria**
- **Proceed**: Cap rate ≥ 8% AND monthly cash flow ≥ $200
- **Caution**: Cap rate ≥ 6% OR monthly cash flow ≥ $100
- **Reject**: Below minimum thresholds or high risk factors

### **Confidence Scoring**
- Based on data quality, comparable count, and market conditions
- Adjusted for risk factors and analysis completeness
- Ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 with clear interpretation guidelines

## Performance Features

### **Caching and Optimization**
- Market data caching with 6-hour expiry
- Comparable property caching for efficiency
- Analysis history tracking for learning
- Performance metrics monitoring

### **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error handling throughout
- Graceful degradation when tools fail
- Detailed error logging and reporting
- Fallback mechanisms for critical functions

### **Scalability**
- Asynchronous processing for concurrent analysis
- Efficient data structures and algorithms
- Configurable analysis parameters
- Modular tool architecture

## Usage Examples

### **Basic Property Analysis**
```python
from app.agents.analyst_agent import AnalystAgent
from app.core.agent_state import StateManager

# Create analyst agent
analyst = AnalystAgent(name="PropertyAnalyst")

# Create state with deal to analyze
state = StateManager.create_initial_state()
state["current_deals"] = [sample_deal]

# Process analysis
updated_state = await analyst.process_state(state)

# Get analysis results
analyzed_deal = updated_state["current_deals"][0]
analysis = analyzed_deal["analysis_data"]
recommendation = analyzed_deal["analyst_recommendation"]
```

### **Direct Task Execution**
```python
# Execute specific analysis task
result = await analyst.execute_task(
    "analyze_property",
    {"deal": property_deal},
    state
)

# Get comprehensive analysis
analysis = result["analysis"]
valuation = analysis["valuation"]
financial_metrics = analysis["financial_metrics"]
strategies = analysis["strategies"]
```

### **Tool Usage**
```python
from app.agents.analyst_tools import AnalystToolManager

# Use tool manager
tool_manager = AnalystToolManager()

# Calculate financial metrics
result = await tool_manager.execute_tool(
    "financial_calculator",
    purchase_price=275000,
    repair_cost=25000,
    monthly_rent=2500
)

financial_metrics = result["result"]["financial_metrics"]
```
